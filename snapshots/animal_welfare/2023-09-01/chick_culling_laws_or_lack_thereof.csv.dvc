    dataset_title_owid: Chick culling laws or lack thereof
    dataset_description_owid: Male baby chicks are commonly killed in laying hens
      hatcheries all around the world, as they provide no value for the egg production
      industry. Only a minority of country has laws to ban this practice. This dataset
      is a compilation of evidence (mostly from the news) of chick culling happening
      in a country, and exceptionally, of existing laws banning it.

      Laws banning chick culling are enforced in a small number of countries (see [this summary](https://animallaweurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Animal-Law-Europe-%E2%80%93-Chick-Killing-Report-2023.pdf) by The European Institute for Animal Law & Policy). This dataset includes additional evidence for laws banning chick culling, as well as evidence for countries (presumably lacking laws on the topic) where culling is commonly practiced.
