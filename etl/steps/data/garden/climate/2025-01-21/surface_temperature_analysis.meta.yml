        The deviation of the average land-sea surface temperature from the 1861-1890 mean, in degrees Celsius.
    description_key:
      - Temperature anomalies show how many degrees Celsius temperatures have changed compared to the 1861-1890 period. This baseline period is commonly used to highlight the changes in temperature since pre-industrial times, prior to major human impacts.
      - Temperature averages and anomalies are calculated over all land and ocean surfaces.
      - The data includes separate measurements for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, which helps researchers analyze regional differences.
      - This data is based on the GISS method which estimates temperatures in areas without data by using information from nearby locations within 1200 kilometers. This is especially useful in the Arctic and Antarctic, where measurements are sparse.
      - Despite different approaches, GISS and other methods show similar global temperature trends.
    description_from_producer: |-
       The 1961-90 period is most often used as a baseline because it is the period recommended by the World Meteorological Organisation. In some cases other periods are used. For global average temperatures, an 1861-1890 period is sometimes used to show the warming since the "pre-industrial" period.
    description_processing: |-
      We switch from using 1951-1980 to using 1861-1890 as our baseline to better show how temperatures have changed since pre-industrial times. For each region, we calculate the mean temperature anomalies for 1961–1990 and for 1861–1890. The difference between these two means serves as the adjustment factor. This factor is applied uniformly to both the temperature anomalies and the confidence intervals to ensure that both the central values and the associated uncertainty bounds are correctly shifted relative to the new 1861–1890 baseline.
